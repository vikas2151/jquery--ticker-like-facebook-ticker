Hello

It's a simple Jquery ticker just like the facebook real time ticker.

i tested this in chrome 15,FF 8,IE 9 and it works fine.

You can use it to scroll text,video,images etc.

just replace the content as per your requirment in index.html file inside

<div class="text">
<p>your content goes here..</p>
</div>
